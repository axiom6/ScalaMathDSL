# DSLs (Domain Specific Languages) in Scala
## by Tom Flaherty

### Scala provides powerful capabablities for both external and internal DSLs

### We will start with a four stage algebra example by:

1. Specify an internal DSL trait with overloaded operators and implicits.
2. Define an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) with a base trait and case classes.
3. Code an external DSL as a grammar with parser combininators.
4. Pattern match with recursion for AST transformations and output.

### We then will circle around to study these stages in depth

### Finally we extend these stages into a complete symbolic math DSL

### with Transcendental functions, Trigonmentty and Calculus.
